Feature Engineering and Data Labeling

**Task 1: Feature Engineering**
You will be given a data set (from Ruter). Please do the following on this data set:

1.1 Identify 5 unique features from this data set.

1.2 Apply feature engineering on them in Python.

1.3 Visualize each feature in the form of a graph using python libraries.

The graph should consist of 2 axis (x and y). Use the features (identified above) on one axis and use any other column/feature on the other axis.

(not part of the assignment) 
If you want to try out something fun, try to draw the graph using multiple axis.

**Task 2: Data Labeling**

You will label some data on a data labeling platform called Bineric which can be accessed at: 
www.bineric.com
Instructions on using Bineric:

1. Sign up using your university email address and use your REAL NAME so we know who you are.
3. Data Labeling is mandatory for everyone. Even if you are in a group, you are still supposed to do data labeling.
5. We have estimated that the data labeling should not take more than 30 minutes.
6. This is an easy part of the assignment. The goal here is to give you an idea on how data labeling is done in real life.
7. The task assignment (Covid19 data labeling: From a set of images identify the infected images) is meant to show you how AI is used in health. This is a harder task to solve, since only health people diagnose and label Xrays. Therefore its not important that you get the right result for this data set. The important thing is that you go through the data set and get an idea on how data labeling is done practically in health.
8. Bineric is a beta site. You might see some bugs. In case of bugs, send an email to me and I will fix it.
